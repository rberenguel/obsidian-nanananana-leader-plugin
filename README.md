## Some use cases

- Splitting vertically or horizontally quickly, without polluting the "main" shortcut list.
- Moving around these splits.
- "Zen" mode, toggling all sidebars and ribbon as a chain of commands.
- Fix some annoyances on mobile (iPad):
    - Switching across panels does not move editing focus to them. Chain _Focus on tab group POS_ with _Focus on last note_ to fix this.
    - Same for splitting vertically / horizontally.
- Shortcuts to files. Like your `Inbox` file, or your `Projects` base, orâ€¦

## Features

This plugin provides a "leader key" functionality, inspired by tmux (or vim), to create a new layer of keybindings.

- **Leader Key**: Press a designated "leader" hotkey (default: `Mod+Space`) to enter a special mode.
- **Command Mappings**: Once in leader mode, press a subsequent key(s) to trigger any Obsidian command, or a series of commands. You can also add hotkeys to open specific files.
- **Customizable**: Configure the leader key, the timeout, and all command mappings through the settings tab.
- **Discoverability**: A status bar item and a border effect indicate when leader mode is active.
- **Help Modal**: Press `?` in leader mode to see a list of all your configured key mappings.

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin is for now _desktop_ (or at least, device with keyboard) only.
